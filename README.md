# Working with a CSV File on MySQL Workbench
The dataset I am working with is about [Netflix Shows](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Cth8F5M7smd4uqE7QNX6vHBSOdK_eank/view?usp=sharing).
One challenging thing I encounter was when I imported empty rows with no data, and so I had to repeat the process.
And one interesting thing was how it auto created the tables based on the dataset provided.  
From the dataset provided, I created different charts to draw some insights from the data.    

**CHART 1:** Total Number of Movie and TV show

From the chart the total number of movie show is greater than that of TV show  

**CHART 2:** Total Count of show id by ratings

The highest number of show id are rated by TV-14 and the least are rated by UR   

**CHART 3:** Total Number of shows released after 2010

From 2010 the number of shows released was low, but it gradually increased by the year 2014 with the highest release in 2018 and then decreased from 2019 to 2021  

**CHART 3:** Top 10 countries with the highest number of shows

From the chart, it indicates that United States leads, with the highest number of both movies and TV shows followed by Indian while France and Mexico are the countries with the least number of movies and TV shows  

From the dataset, we can draw insights that movie are more preffered that tv shows, also United States is leading on the number of TV shows and movies released compared to other countries
