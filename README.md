# Working with a CSV File on MySQL Workbench
The dataset I am working with is about [Netflix Shows](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Cth8F5M7smd4uqE7QNX6vHBSOdK_eank/view?usp=sharing).
One challenging thing I encounter was when I imported empty rows with no data, and so I had to repeat the process.
And one interesting thing was how it auto created the tables based on the dataset provided.
